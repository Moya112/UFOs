# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a UFO webpage for a hypothetical client "Dana," which has a dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. This webpage is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Resources
Here are the requirements to create this web application:

- VS Code editor that supports the following:
 - HTML
 - JavaScript
 - D3.js
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap 
 
 ## Webpage Results
 To filter the UFO sighting data, type the search criteria into the specified fields. Example placeholder entries are visible in each area to guide user responses and enter information in the correct format. For example, the "Enter Date" field takes searches in a numbered form, such as 1/4/2010. The table will then update and return results after entering search fields. However, the table will be empty if there are no matches.

## Multiple Search Criteria
We are able retrieve multiple UFOs sightings by adding a search filter.

# Summary
The resulting dynamic Web Page has all the data Dana asked for, but the information is not real-time. Even though the webpage might look appealing to the eye, there is room for improvement. The webpage would be more beneficial for users if they could also retrieve current data for UFO sightings. The webpage is also restrictive, and the user has to be specific. There should be other options to get the information. 

# Recommendations for Improvement
- The user should be able to retrieve past and current UFO sightings. 
- There should be a dropdown menu for filters where you can navigate the webpage more efficiently. 
- There should be a pop-up window for data that are not available.
- The locations of past and current sightings would be important, so a map should be added to the webpage.
