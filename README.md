# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a UFO webpage for a hypothetical client "Dana," which has a dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. This webpage is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Resources
Here are the requirements to create this web application:

- VS Code editor that supports the following:
 - HTML
 - JavaScript
 - D3.js
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap 
 
 ## Webpage Results
 To filter the UFO sighting data, type the search criteria into the specified fields. Example placeholder entries are visible in each area to guide user responses and enter information in the correct format. For example, the "Enter Date" field takes searches in a numbered form, such as 1/4/2010. The table will then update and return results after entering search fields. However, the table will be empty if there are no matches.
